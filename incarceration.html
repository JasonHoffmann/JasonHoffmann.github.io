            <p>As a non-profit organization, Sesame Workshop frequently creates community outreach projects for families and children in need. Through these efforts, the Workshop has helped children in military families, children of divorce and families in economic distress. One of the more staggering recent outreach projects was helping children of incarcerated parents. It is a problem that we don’t often think about, but one that is so prevalent it should be a lot harder to miss. They called it “Little Children, Big Challenges: Incarceration.”</p>
            <p>The LCBC team knew that part of the problem was the lack of education in the general public about the problems surrounding families with an incarcerated adult. It became the task of me and my team to help change that.</p>
            <blockquote>
                1 in 28 children in the United States have a parent in state or federal prison.
            </blockquote>
            <p>This is the first statistic I was introduced to. And yet most people would never know. For me that number seemed shocking, unbelievable even. It’s possible I’ve met someone in my life that was effected by an incarcerated adult in their life. In fact, not just possible, <em>likely.</em></p>
            <p>As it turns out, one of the biggest problems in this community is a stigma that encourages silence over communication. Children in these families have no one to talk to, and they are sometimes told that remaining quiet is for the best. And most of the time, this advice is correct, because people aren’t aware of their struggles and may even look down upon them. It’s much easier for children with say, parents in the military, to talk openly about their troubles. But what can a kid say when his mom or dad is in prison? Who would even understand?</p>
            <p>If we could wake a few people up to the realities of this life-changing circumstance, then maybe we could move the needle, even just a hair.</p>

                <h3>Telling the Story</h3>
                <p>It seemed that the clearest course of action was to try and tell the story of these children’s experience and feelings so that others could learn from it. If the general public could be informed about the emotional circumstances of these children, maybe speaking up would even be encouraged.</p>
                <p>We decided to start with identifying the most common problem in these communities. Our research team had been working hard on that very issue, and we had lots of data to pull from. We watched interviews with children of incarcerated parents, and viewed the materials that the Workshop team had put together to help them. We worked with the research team to boil these experiences down to single quotes. Little stories that reflected a single experience. After several weeks, we identified the strongest four:</p>
                <p>Each of these, in their own way, told a piece of the story. Letters, for instance, are the main form of communication for children and their incarcerated parents. It might be strange to imagine a world where you can’t make a quick phone call to your parents, but that was their reality.</p>
                <p>With the quotes in hand, we moved on to how we would communicate them.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    Sometimes I feel ashamed and confused, other times I feel happy because I get to see my Mom

                    It feels good to keep in touch with my Dad. I write him letters and visit him. Sometimes, I even get letters back.

                <h3>Picking the Platform</h3>
                <p>From the beginning, we knew that the site that we created would have to juxtapose informational long form content alongside the quotes. In order for this to work, the four quotes would have to be presented in a way that was both visually and functionally distinct. They couldn’t simply be represented as text on a page. They should move and dance the Sesame way, reflecting both their somber content, but also a desire for change.</p>
                <p>It just so happened that <a href="https://vine.co/">Vine</a> had been introduced to the general public while we were brainstorming ideas. A coworker suggested that we create stop-motion Vines for the quotes. That way, each one could exist on it’s own, and can tell a chunk of the story. That piece could be spread outside the canvas of our site, and then direct back to a longer form webpage for more information. It seemed perfect. As a media company, Sesame could play to it’s strengths of creating bite-sized, interactive and educational content. Only this time, it would be for everybody, not just for children ages 0-5.</p>
                <p>We collaborated with the Creative Services team, ran through a few iterations of what the quotes could look like and gave them a Sesame feel. We wanted to keep it raw, so we decided to do simple animations with sketches on a chalkboard or slips of paper. We ran a few tests, and were ready to go.</p>

                <h3>Designing the Site</h3>
                <p>During this time, I was tasked with the design and development of the page itself. Sesame has a long-standing aesthetic tradition, but this was also a piece of content that was somewhat unlike what we normally do. It wasn’t for children, it was for adults everywhere. For most people coming to the site, this would be the first time they ever heard of such a problem. And the design needed to reflect that.</p>
                <p>In my head, I knew that I wanted to lead with the simple statistic that had resonated so deeply with me. That would be the header, the first thing that you come to. After that, I would focus on the content to create a distraction free and comfortable reading experience for the user. It began with the Vines each arranged in four boxes, the content underneath. At the top would be the statistic and introduction.</p>
                <p>I moved to the browser to bring my sketch into code, but quickly realized that the grid only added confusion. The beauty and the trouble with Vines is that they are infinitely looping and in motion. Placing two Vines side by side created confusion, and it was next to impossible to focus. So I broke the site down into a single column. Each Vine would occupy half the screen, and the content would occupy the other half. That way, the reader would only have to focus on one experience at a time.</p>
                <p>But putting it all together still made the site feel overly structured. Digesting one Vine and content, then another Vine and content, etc. didn’t have that Sesame effect. I realized that there needed to be a break, some unique story that had a spark to it. A free-flowing and simple palette cleanser between experiences that informed the rest of the story.</p>

                <h3>Title Cards</h3>
                <p>While studying the materials that were created by our community engagement team for children coping with this struggle, I found a short animation which follows a young girl visiting her father in prison. For children, it is a story that they could identify with, and it said out loud what they were only thinking. But for someone like me, who has never heard a story for like that, it was a small window of understanding. In just a couple of minutes, this animation let me walk in that child’s shoes.</p>
                <p>That was the palette cleanser I needed. I’m a film buff, and title cards were always interesting to me. I thought I might take this concept to the web, and show a small piece of the story, an image and a quote form the animation, before the reader moved on the contents of each Vine. By the end of the web page, my hope was that they would have the macro-experience from the Vine quotes and long form content, but also an emotional micro-experience from the deeply personal story. In the end, I think the story cards brought the page together, and amplified it’s moving content.</p>

                <h3>Coding It Up</h3>
                <p>Because it did not have a lot of moving parts, I decided against any sort of back-end for the page, and kept it as static HTML. The priority for me was to be performance, since I knew the Vines themselves would be loading in a lot of external scripts and resources. I took a mobile-first approach to the front-end development to ensure that the site kept as lightweight as possible, no matter what the device.</p>
                <p>As for the architecture itself, I turned to SASS to create a simple grid system based on <a href="http://purecss.io/">Pure CSS</a> coupled with a simple float layout. By making everything in my CSS modular, I was able to keep the stylesheet to about 500 lines. There were only a few complex interactions on the page, such as a sliding cover images, but for those I used CSS3 with built in fallbacks. This meant that besides the Vine Javascript automatically loaded in, I had no need for any other external JS files.</p>
                <p>The Vines turned out to be the most difficult part of the site. For performance, I simply made sure that the script was being loaded in asynchronously so the initial page view was loaded quickly. But making the boxes responsive was a little more challenging. I ended up using the padding-bottom aspect ratio trick that is used in <a href="http://fitvidsjs.com/">FitVids</a>. But since I knew the aspect ratio ahead of time, I didn’t need JS to calculate it, and I was able to keep it all in the CSS.</p>
                <p>Development started with a single layout, then I layered on media queries to affect single columns becoming two, and regulated text lengths in em units, so that the length of each line was always at a comfortable level.</p>
                <p>It was a simple project, but being able to see it across different devices and browsers was a great treat at the end.</p>
                <p>The site didn’t change the world, but that was never really it’s goal. We were able to educate a few people on the problem, and had more then a few think twice about the problems at stake. And thanks to our efforts, there was a huge resurgence in interest for the Outreach kits for children of incarcerated parents six months after the project had launched, which was more then we could have asked for. It was work I could be proud of.</p>
