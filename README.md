=======================

This is the personal site of me, Jay Hoffmann. I'm going to keep this updated as the project changes, and hopefully be able to link up some of the resources that guided me as I built it.

If you happen to find anything wrong with the site, please post an Issue and I'll get around to it.

Thanks.
